    <P>The sea and the oceans are the vast, breathing heart of our planet, covering more than seventy percent of Earth’s
        surface and holding mysteries deeper than imagination.
        The ocean is not just water; it is life, movement, and power — a world of endless blue stretching beyond the
        horizon, where sunlight dances on the waves and darkness guards the silent depths below.
        From the warm shores of the Pacific Ocean to the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean, the oceans shape climate, carry
        storms, and cradle countless forms of life, from tiny plankton to the largest animal ever known, the blue whale.
        The rhythm of tides rises and falls like a heartbeat, whispering stories of ancient times and distant lands,
        connecting continents and cultures across the globe.
        The sea can be calm and gentle, reflecting the sky like a mirror, or fierce and unstoppable during tempests,
        reminding us of nature’s strength. It feeds millions of people, supports ecosystems like coral reefs and
        mangroves, and produces much of the oxygen we breathe.
        To say “I am only sea” is to feel vast, deep, and ever-changing — sometimes peaceful, sometimes stormy, but
        always powerful, mysterious, and alive with hidden wonders beneath the surface.</P>
